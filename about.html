  <h2>Evolving my creative expression to unlock my/our human potential.</h2>
  <h3>Pitch Deck Design —> Graphic Design —> Web & App Design —> Entreprenurship</h3>
  <p>I find purpose, joy and sometimes sorrow in learning about the complexities and nuances of what it means to be human during these unprecendented times. What a wild time it is to be alive! <br>
    <br>As signs point to some sort of global catastrophic risk, the question that comes up for me is, how can I help? <br>
    <br>Howard Thurman emerged for me and said, “Don’t ask what the world needs. Ask what makes you come alive, and go do it. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive.” <br>
    <br>I am enlivened by the art of communication, creativity and design and it’s potential to inspire, empower and uplift. I am passionate about translating complex, deep and profound concepts into simple, clear, tangible, relatable and practical
    tools
    that deepen our relationships to one another so that we can unlock and empower our individual and collective potential. <br>
    <br>So now, I turn that question to you, what makes you come alive? <br>
    <br>Let’s connect, explore and discover together. If you sense alignment between us or if your curiosity is peaked, even just a bit, please do reach out.
